            <p>Hello. I am Frank South, a programmer with a focus in Web Development. I am a driven and self-motivated individual that is currently looking for a job as a Junior Developer. Please take a look around and view my projects. I hope that you enjoy my website as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>

            <h3>Why Web Dev?</h3>
            <p>I graduated from East Carolina University with a B.S. in Kinesiology. Originally, I had my sight set on Biomechanics. I decided that I would work in a corporate environment within my scope (Corporate Health). With this, I wanted to build a strong foundation of professional skills before pursuing my Masters in Biomechanics.</p>
            <p>
                Eventually, I landed at NetApp, and did not realize at the time how this specific company would change the trajectory of my career. I learned the things that I set out to learn. Building projects from the ground up, the documentation/revisions that went with that. All of the different departments that I had to maintain strong relationships with, meeting-culture, and the strict standards that a corporate environment holds one to.
            </p>    
            <p>
                But even more importantly, I built a very strong rapport with Software Developers. This is where my career goals changed.
